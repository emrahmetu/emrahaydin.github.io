## About

I am currently a London based Data Analyst and Director of Elbruz Consulting Limited. I have recently completed my studies towards a Master's degree at Big Data Analytics and Management. I have a strong interest in Python, machine learning, data visualisation and statistical modelling. I also have undergraduate degree at Business Administration and Master of Business Administration (MBA). 

My project, You Have My Car (Arabam Sende), was selected in the top 10 in the entrepreneurship competition of TUSIAD. (https://www.bugenclikteisvar.com/bilgi-merkezi/katilimcilar/2011)
