Portfolio 

## About

I am currently a London based Data Analyst and Director of Elbruz Consulting Limited. I have recently completed my studies towards a Master's degree at Big Data Analytics and Management. I have a strong interest in Python, machine learning, data visualisation and statistical modelling. I also have undergraduate degree at Business Administration and Master of Business Administration (MBA). 

My project, You Have My Car (Arabam Sende), was selected in the top 10 in the entrepreneurship competition of TUSIAD. (https://www.bugenclikteisvar.com/bilgi-merkezi/katilimcilar/2011)

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Video Games Sales Analysis
**Code:** [`video_games_sales.ipynb`](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/video_games_sales.ipynb)    
**Description:** The dataset contains 16715 records as of 2016. There is a list of video games with sales (by region), year of release, platform, critics and users score. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing region based user profiles, measuring statistical factors, hypothesis testing.  
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** Review of the global and regional video games markets, data-based business recommendations.  


## Study Projects
In this section I will provide links to my github repositories containing code and jupyter notebooks I created while passing online courses or was just having fun with.

### sklearn ML course
**Description:** Machine Learning in Python with scikit-learn by France Université Numérique. [The course official page](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/en/courses/machine-learning-python-scikit-learn/).  
This 3 month course is an in-depth introduction to predictive modeling with scikit-learn. Step-by-step and didactic lessons introduce the fundamental methodological and software tools of machine learning, and is as such a stepping stone to more advanced challenges in artificial intelligence, text mining, or data science.  
**Repository:** Check the repository having jupyter notebooks with the course lectures and tasks' solutions ---> [go to repo..](https://github.com/nktnlx/sklearn_ml_course)  
**Status:** Completed in May 2022 (please, check the certificates section below).
